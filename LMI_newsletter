PC/FORTH 3.2 and PC/FORTH+ 3.2

LMI is pleased to announce the release of PC/FORTH and PC/FORTH+
versions 3.2.  These new versions represent a significant improvement
in capability.  The new or improved features include:

     Full path support throughout;

     An enhanced, two-level file interface that allows you to
     compile identical code on PC/FORTH 3.2, PC/FORTH+ 3.2, and
     UR/FORTH;

     "Well-behaved" use of system dynamic memory allocation
     functions;

     Powerful new string handling operators (search, extract,
     compare, and concatenate) and dynamic string storage
     manager;

     A completely rewritten, much faster binary overlay loader
     (the PC/FORTH+ overlay loader now supports all three
     relocation types: paragraph, 16-bit offset, and 32-bit
     offsets);

     An improved multitasker with programmable delays and
     semaphores;

     Enhanced user interface, including a SHELL command that
     allows you to run any DOS command, batch file, or program
     (either interactively or under the control of a Forth
     application) and examine its return code;

     Completely new table-driven full-screen editor and assembler
     supplied in both overlay and source code form (includes all
     80286 and 80287 mnemonics).

     Maximum possible compatibility with UR/FORTH on the source
     code level.

     3.5" media available on request at no extra charge;

     Internal serialization of the Forth system and graphics
     drivers discontinued.

Updates are available to registered users of PC/FORTH and PC/FORTH+ at
a nominal charge.  An order form for updates is included in this
newsletter.

New Products

UR/FORTH for Microsoft OS/2.  A fully functional version of UR/FORTH
that runs in protected mode under OS/2 is now available.  UR/FORTH for
OS/2 allows full access to the operating system's facilities for
multi-tasking, virtual memory management, and inter-process
communication.  Turnkey applications can be compiled with UR/FORTH for
OS/2 and distributed without any license fee or royalty.

Until January 1, 1988, registered users of the MS-DOS version of
UR/FORTH and of the IBM or Microsoft OS/2 Software Development Kits
can obtain a copy of the OS/2 version of UR/FORTH at no charge.  After
January 1, the upgrade to the OS/2 version for registered MS-DOS
UR/FORTH owners will be $100.


UR/FORTH for Windows.  A preliminary version of UR/FORTH is now
running under Microsoft Windows 1.03.  It will be available for
purchase after Microsoft begins shipping the retail version of Windows
2.0, which will probably be 4th Qtr 1987.


UR/FORTH for 80386.  A 32-bit version of UR/FORTH for the Intel 80386
is under development, and should be available for purchase in
November, 1987.  Preliminary timings indicate that the 32-bit 80386
UR/FORTH will offer a 4 GB address space at virtually no speed penalty
(compared to the 16-bit UR/FORTH running on the same machine), due to
the 80386's improved addressing modes and instruction set.


New Metacompiler Targets.  New 16-bit targets for the 6809, 6303,
HD64180, and Z-8 microprocessors are now available.  A target for the
Super 8 is in preparation.

New 32-bit targets for the 8086 and 68000 are now available.  The 32-
bit 8086 target is symmetric with the PC/FORTH+ implementation, while
the 32-bit 68000 target is a ROMable, token threaded implementation
developed by Klaus Flesch of Forth Systeme Angelika Flesch in West
Germany.

LMI also performs custom ports of its Forth systems by special
arrangement.  The usual porting fee is $5000, but this fee may be
substantially reduced if loaner hardware is provided and LMI retains
the rights to market the system.


SRS-63 EPROM Simulator.  Klaus Flesch of Forth Systeme Angelika
Flesch, West Germany, has developed a new EPROM simulator that can
support up to 63 KB of address space.  The simulator includes IBM PC
host software that allows you to download precompiled images, edit and
download source code, and debug interactively using the target
system's interpreter without the need for a separate serial port.

The SRS-63 will be available in the U.S.A. through LMI in late 1987.
A data sheet for this product is available on request.

Technical Support

Technical support for LMI Forth products is available by several
avenues of electronic mail.

The quickest way to obtain technical support is to leave a message on
the LMI Forth Board at (213) 306-3530.  This board is available 7 days
a week, 24 hours a day, and supports 1200, 2400, and 9600 baud.  The
LMI Forth Board also offers some 20 MB of Forth source code,
tutorials, useful MS-DOS utilities and programming aids.

You can also contact LMI via MCI Mail (lmi or 114-9487), BIX (join lmi
to post a message in the LMI Vendor Support Conference), or CompuServe
Easyplex (72406,1577).

After over two years of experience running a bulletin board service
for users, we have become convinced that electronic mail is by far the
most efficient means of providing technical support --- for both
ourselves and our customers.  Consequently, technical support by voice
phone call will be discontinued as of September 1, 1987: technical
support will be available only by electronic mail.  For a limited
time, LMI will be offering 1200 baud Hayes-compatible internal modems,
bundled with ProComm telecommunications software, to registered users
for $100 (our cost).

When you make a request for technical support, be sure to include the
following vital information:

     A general idea of what you are trying to do;

     A detailed description of the problem;

     Your development environment (including version numbers);

     System software configuration (including version numbers), and
     type of machine being used;

     The possibilities you've already exhausted (and their results);

     Your name, company name, and the serial number of your Forth
     system.

An answer to your question, or a request for further information, will
generally be posted to you within 24 hours.  Please do not request or
expect a phone call in answer to your question; this eliminates the
advantages of electronic mail for all concerned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electronic Updates

We have been posting free incremental updates to the MS-DOS version of
UR/FORTH on the LMI Forth Board since the release of UR/FORTH in 1986.
This has been very popular with UR/FORTH owners, and has proven to be
an economical way to distribute enhancements to the UR/FORTH screen
editor, assembler, multi-tasker, and other tools.

Accordingly, over the next few months, we will also be establishing a
procedure to distribute free incremental updates for PC/FORTH and
PC/FORTH+ via the LMI Forth Board.  However, this service will only be
available to purchasers of the 3.2 update.
Mailing List Cleanup

This is the last newsletter that will be sent to all known present and
previous users of LMI Forth products.  Our mailing list has been
growing for over six years and needs pruning badly.

If you wish to continue to receive LMI newsletters and update
announcements, you must affix the newsletter mailing label to the
enclosed postcard, make any necessary address corrections, and return
the postcard to LMI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Packaging and Pricing Changes

Coincident with the release of PC/FORTH and PC/FORTH+ versions 3.2, we
are making a number of changes in our pricing and packaging structure.
The thrust of these changes is to provide an integrated development
environment at a much lower price than before, and eliminate the
confusing menu of "extension packages."

PC/FORTH version 3.2                                           $150.00

     Interpreter/compiler, editor, assembler, host file interface,
     relocating binary overlay utility, 400 page manual.

PC/FORTH+ version 3.2                                          $250.00

     Interpreter/compiler, editor, assembler, host file interface,
     relocating binary overlay utility, 400 page manual.

Programmer's Package #1 (16-bit)                               $250.00

     PC/FORTH 3.2 (16-bit) as above, software floating point, Intel
     8087 support, graphics driver (IBM CGA, EGA, Hercules), and
     native code optimizer.

Programmer's Package #2 (32-bit)                               $350.00

     PC/FORTH+ 3.2 (32-bit) as above, software floating point, Intel
     8087 support, graphics driver (IBM CGA, EGA, Hercules), and
     native code optimizer.

Programmer's Package #3 (16-bit and 32-bit)                    $500.00

     PC/FORTH 3.2 (16-bit) and PC/FORTH+ 3.2 (32-bit) as above,
     software floating point, Intel 8087 support, graphics driver (IBM
     CGA, EGA, Hercules), and native code optimizer.

The PC/FORTH and PC/FORTH+ software floating point, Intel 8087
support, graphics support, and native code optimizer will no longer be
available for purchase as separate extension packages.

For the present, we will continue to sell the floating point and
native code optimizer extension packages separately for 8086 FORTH,
8086 FORTH+, and Z-80 FORTH.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

LMI Products Withdrawn

The following LMI Forth systems are withdrawn from the price list as
of September 1, 1987:

The B-tree index manager, symbolic debugger, cross reference utility,
and PC/TERM extension packages will also be withdrawn as of September
1, 1987.  They will be placed (together with their documentation
files) on the LMI Bulletin Board System and may be downloaded at no
charge by all registered users.  Overseas distributors will be
supplied with master disks for these four extensions which they can
duplicate and supply to their customers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

LMI Products Frozen

The following Forth systems remain on the price list for the present,
but will not be updated for symmetry with IBM PC/FORTH 3.2 and
UR/FORTH because of vanishing market demand:
